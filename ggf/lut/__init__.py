    Notes
    -----
    - To avoid invalid values in the look-up table (LUT), such as
      `semi_major < semi_mino` or `object_index < medium_index`,
      the LUT is not built using the exact same keyword arguments
      as this method:
    
      - `object_index` is stored as
        ``relative_object_index = object_index / medium_index``
      - `semi_major` is stored as
        ``stretch_ratio = (semi_major - semi_minor) / semi_minor``
    - The following keywords are not interpolated in the LUT:
      - `model`
      - `wavelength`: the OS uses a fixed wavelength
      - `mode_field_diameter`: the fiber geometry is fixed
      - `power_per_fiber`: good practice and reproducibility
      - `n_poly`: set to a high number (e.g. 120)
    - The following keywords are linear and thus only span a
      a dimension of size two:
      - poisson_ratio: good linearity
      - power_per_fiber: good linearity
      - effective_fiber_distance: linear only within 15Âµm interval
    - The following keywords are not linear and are thus sampled
      with more points:
      - relative_object_index
      - medium_index
      - stretch_ratio
      - semi_minor

    # convert major_axis to stretch ratio
    stretch_ratio = (semi_major - semi_minor) / semi_minor
    # normalize object index with medium_index
    relative_object_index = object_index / medium_index
    # determine the correct look-up table
